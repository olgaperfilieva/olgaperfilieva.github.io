     <p>
         I embrace all things design. I have had the privilege of channeling this passion through my work - from conceptualizing beautiful yet functional living spaces to the creation of rich and compelling websites.

<p>
Originally from Kyiv, Ukraine, I received a Bachelor of Science in Interior Design from Drexel University. My insatiable appetite for anything related to style, travel and music has me always devising ways to incorporate the latest great find into my creations. No matter the medium, I love the satisfaction of bringing clean, intuitive and elegant interfaces to reality and enjoy the pursuit of finding new and inventive ways of enhancing everyday experiences.
</p>
<p>
I believe in insight through dedication;
I believe in the power of relationships; and
I believe every good opportunity should be seized.
